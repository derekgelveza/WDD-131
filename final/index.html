            <p>Hi there, and welcome to my personal porfolio website! My name is Derek Gelvez, and I'm a second-year
                Computer Science Student. This site is a collection of my academic and person projects, which reflect my techincal skills, and 
                my passion for software development. Here, you'll find projects that show how I apply what I've learned in Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
                to solve real live problems. Each project includes context, tools used, and the lessons I took away from building it. You'll also find
                a summary of my technical skills and a dwonloadable resume.<br><br>

                Thanks for visiting! I hope you find something that sparks your interest. If you have any questions or would like to connect
                feel free to reach out through the contact page.
            </p>
