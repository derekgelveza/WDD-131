			<h2>Derek Gelvez</h2>
			<h2>WDD 131-04</h2>

			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>Showcase my projects, technical skills, and sofware engineering mindset so hiring managers and recruiters can quickly evaluate fit for product- and software engineering-focused roles.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>Recruiters, hiring managers, and others</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I want a dynamic nav that briefly says welcome, and then switches to the nav. I want a dynamic drop down nav for smaller screen sizes. I want to use js for a list of my projects where all I have to do is have an id or class in html and then the js will fill up the rest with the information I give it.
                I would also want the projects to be displayed dynamically but I'm not sure how I would want to do that yet. And since I am fluent in spanish I want there to be a button to change the Page
                and everything in it to be in spanish
            </p>

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

            <p>I want to use a dynamic js background of like space or stars which is why the colors are rather dark</p>

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:
			<a href="https://coolors.co/02010a-04052e-140152-22007c-0d00a4" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c</a>

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>
						<th>Secondary</th>
						<th>Accent 1</th>
						<th>Accent 2</th>
					</tr>
					<!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
					<tr>
						<td class="primary">[#02010A]</td>
						<td class="secondary">[#04052E]</td>
						<td class="accent1">[#22007C]</td>
						<td class="accent2"></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h4>
				Heading Font: Dosis
				<!-- change this -->
			</h4>
			<h4>
				Paragraph Font: Saira Extra Condensed
				<!-- change this -->
			</h4>
			<h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
			<p>
				Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
				tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim
				veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea

			<!-- ------------------------Step 10------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Navigation</h3>
			<!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->
			<nav>
				<a href="#">Home</a>
				<a href="#">Resume</a>
				<a href="#">Projects</a>
                <a href="#">Contact</a>
			</nav>
			<hr>

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>Professional headshot of myself, my name
				I want it to have a quick about me since I'm treating the home page as an about me essentially
				I will need a button somewhere to change the language and also the dynamic nav for both desktop and mobile
				I want the resume to be kind of like a pop up where it opens as if it was a different tab but only in the home page where the 
				person on the site can look at it and have the option to download it
			</p>
			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>This will be my projects page where I want a slider or a carousel and if you're on a specific "slide" it shows the project name, details about the project, and 
				finally the languages and/or frameworks that were used. And as the user slides to the next one it will dynamically take the previous projects place and display it
			</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				I want the center info of the about me to scroll 
			</p>
			<img src="images/homewireframe.jpg" alt="home page wireframe">

			<h3>Projects</h3>
			<p>
				the * is where the langauges / frameworks used in the project will be displayed
